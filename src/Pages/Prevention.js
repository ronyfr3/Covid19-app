      <h3>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Prevention: 12 Tips and Strategies</h3>
      <p>
        The new coronavirus is officially called SARS-CoV-2, which stands for
        severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. An infection with this
        virus can lead to coronavirus disease 19, or COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is
        related to the coronavirus SARS-CoV, which caused another kind of
        coronavirus disease in 2002 to 2003. However, from what we know so far,
        SARS-CoV-2 is different from other viruses, including other
        coronaviruses. The evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted
        more easily and cause life-threatening illness in some people. Like
        other coronaviruses, it can survive in the air and on surfaces long
        enough for someone to contract it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s possible that you could acquire SARS-CoV-2 if you touch your mouth,
        nose, or eyes after touching a surface or object that has the virus on
        it. However, this is not thought to be the main way that the virus
        spreads However, SARS-CoV-2 multiplies faster in the body even when you
        don’t have symptoms. Additionally, you can transmit the virus even if
        you never get symptoms at all. Some people have mild to moderate
        symptoms only, while others have severe COVID-19 symptoms. Here are the
        medical facts to help us understand how to best protect ourselves and
        others.

      <h3>Tips for prevention</h3>
      <p>
        Follow the guidelines to help protect yourself from contracting and
        transmitting SARS-CoV-2.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Wash your hands frequently and carefully Use warm water and soap and
        rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists,
        between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an
        antibacterial and antiviral soap. Use hand sanitizer when you cannot
        wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day,
        especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop. 2.
        Avoid touching your face SARS-CoV-2 can live on some surfaces for up to
        72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if you touch a surface
        like: gas pump handle your cell phone a doorknob Avoid touching any part
        of your face or head, including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also avoid
        biting your fingernails. This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from
        your hands into your body. 3. Stop shaking hands and hugging people —
        for now Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin-to-skin contact can
        transmit SARS-CoV-2 from one person to another. 4. Don’t share personal
        items Do not share personal items like: phones makeup combs It’s also
        important not to share eating utensils and straws. Teach children to
        recognize their reusable cup, straw, and other dishes for their own use
        only. 5. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze SARS-CoV-2
        is found in high amounts in the nose and mouth. This means it can be
        carried by air droplets to other people when you cough, sneeze, or talk.
        It can also land on hard surfaces and stay there for up to 3 days. Use a
        tissue or sneeze into your elbow to keep your hands as clean as
        possible. Wash your hands carefully after you sneeze or cough,
        regardless. 6. Clean and disinfect surfaces Use alcohol-based
        disinfectants to clean hard surfaces in your home like: countertops door
        handles furniture toys Also, clean your phone, laptop, and anything else
        you use regularly several times a day. Disinfect areas after you bring
        groceries or packages into your home. Use white vinegar or hydrogen
        peroxide solutions for general cleaning in between disinfecting
        surfaces. 7. Take physical (social) distancing seriously If you’re
        carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it’ll be found in high amounts in your
        spit (sputum). This can happen even if you don’t have symptoms. Physical
        (social) distancing, also means staying home and working remotely when
        possible. If you must go out for necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet
        (2 m) from other people. You can transmit the virus by speaking to
        someone in close contact to you. 8. Do not gather in groups Being in a
        group or gathering makes it more likely that you’ll be in close contact
        with someone. This includes avoiding all religious places of worship, as
        you may have to sit or stand too close to another congregant. It also
        includes not congregating at parks or beaches. 9. Avoid eating or
        drinking in public places Now is not the time to go out to eat. This
        means avoiding restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and other eateries. The
        virus can be transmitted through food, utensils, dishes, and cups. It
        may also be temporarily airborne from other people in the venue. You can
        still get delivery or takeaway food. Choose foods that are thoroughly
        cooked and can be reheated. High heat (at least 132°F/56°C, according to
        one recent, not-yet-peer-reviewed lab study) helps to kill
        coronaviruses. This means it may be best to avoid cold foods from
        restaurants and all food from buffets and open salad bars. 10. Wash
        fresh groceries Wash all produce under running water before eating or
        preparing. The CDCTrusted Source and the FDATrusted Source do not
        recommend using soap, detergent, or commercial produce wash on things
        like fruits and vegetables. Be sure to wash hands before and after
        handling these items. 11. Wear a (homemade) mask The Centers for Disease
        Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendsTrusted Source that almost
        everyone wears a cloth face mask in public settings where physical
        distancing may be difficult, such as grocery stores. When used
        correctly, these masks can help prevent people who are asymptomatic or
        undiagnosed from transmitting SARS-CoV-2 when they breathe, talk,
        sneeze, or cough. This, in turn, slows the transmission of the virus.
        The CDC’s website provides instructionsTrusted Source for making your
        own mask at home, using basic materials such as a T-shirt and scissors.
        Some pointers to keep in mind: Wearing a mask alone will not prevent you
        from getting a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Careful handwashing and physical
        distancing must also be followed. Cloth masks aren’t as effective as
        other types of masks, such as surgical masks or N95 respirators.
        However, these other masks should be reserved for healthcare workers and
        first responders. Wash your hands before you put on your mask. Wash your
        mask after each use. You can transfer the virus from your hands to the
        mask. If you’re wearing a mask, avoid touching the front of it. You can
        also transfer the virus from the mask to your hands. Wash your hands if
        you touch the front of the mask. A mask shouldn’t be worn by a child
        under 2 years old, a person who has trouble breathing, or a person who
        can’t remove the mask on their own. 12. Self-quarantine if sick Call
        your doctor if you have any symptoms. Stay home until you recover. Avoid
        sitting, sleeping, or eating with your loved ones even if you live in
        the same home. Wear a mask and wash your hands as much as possible. If
        you need urgent medical care, wear a mask and let them know you may have
        COVID-19.
