        Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?
      </h3>
      <p>
        On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official
        name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus
        outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease
        is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’
        stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly,
        this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly
        cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease,
        caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen
        in humans.

      <h3>Why Did the Coronavirus Outbreak Start in China?</h3>
      <p>Let’s talk about the cultural causes of this epidemic.</p>

        The new coronavirus disease has a name now: COVID-19. That took a while.
        The virus’s genome was sequenced within two weeks or so of its
        appearance, but for many weeks more, we didn’t know what to call it or
        the disease it causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, in some quarters, the disease went by “Wuhan pneumonia,”
        after the city in central China where the first human infections were
        detected. But guidelines from the World Health Organization, which
        christened COVID-19 recently, discourage naming diseases after locations
        or people, among other things, to avoid “unintended negative impacts by
        stigmatizing certain communities.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed. On Jan. 29, an Australian tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch
        featured on its front page a red face mask stamped with “Chinese Virus
        Pandamonium”: The emphasis on “panda” was the paper’s doing, so the
        misspelling it highlighted presumably was deliberate, too. A Chinese
        student in Melbourne protested in an op-ed in another paper, “This virus
        is not ‘Chinese.’” Of course, the virus isn’t Chinese, even if its
        origin eventually is traced back to a cave in China; nor is the disease
        that it causes.
